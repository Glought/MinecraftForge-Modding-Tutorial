MinecraftForge-Modding-Tutorial
===============================

I try to get as much tutorials up as i can even i go and fix some things where i made misstakes.

if you find a misstake or a way to do it better fork and send me a pull request i will go and check it out

## Pull Requests ##

if you want to add your tutorial send me a pull request with the files.

i check if they are right or if i dont know what it is i try it out if i get it i add it to the tutorials else you have to rework it.

## MinecraftForge Wiki ##

i go and add time after time the tutorials to the minecraft forge wiki, where i write 'em in a longer way and explain more.
